# Emotion Detection with Smooth Grad-CAM++

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This project focuses on facial emotion detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on grayscale facial images (48x48 pixels). It also implements Smooth Grad-CAM++ to visualize which regions of the image contribute to the modelâ€™s decision, providing explainability for the model's predictions.
